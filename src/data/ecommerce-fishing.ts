    description: "A specialized ecommerce retailer offering premium fishing clothing, rods, reels, tackle, and accessories to serious anglers nationwide. The company built a loyal customer base through quality product curation and excellent customer service, but their paid advertising was underperforming due to generic campaigns, poor seasonal planning, and lack of audience segmentation. With an average order value of $245 and strong organic traffic from their established brand, they needed to maximize their $20,000 monthly ad spend to capture the seasonal fishing market effectively, particularly during the critical spring and summer months when fishing activity peaks.",

      title: "Poor Seasonal Campaign Planning and Budget Allocation",
      description: "The fishing industry is highly seasonal, with 73% of annual gear purchases happening between March and August when fishing activity peaks. However, the company was running flat budgets year-round, missing peak season opportunities while wasting spend during slower winter months. Their campaigns weren't aligned with fishing calendar events like bass season openers, trout stocking, and tournament schedules, resulting in inefficient targeting when competitor activity was highest and customer intent fluctuated dramatically.",
    },
    {
      title: "Generic Product Campaigns Without Audience Segmentation",
      description: "All fishing gear was being promoted through broad campaigns to generic 'fishing enthusiasts' audiences, despite vastly different customer profiles between bass anglers, fly fishermen, deep-sea enthusiasts, and casual weekend anglers. Each segment has distinct gear needs, seasonal patterns, and spending behaviors, but the lack of segmentation meant high-intent freshwater spring campaigns competed with year-round saltwater messaging, diluting relevance and driving up costs in an already competitive keyword space.",
    },
    {
      title: "High Cost Per Lead With Poor Qualification and Attribution",
      description: "Cost per qualified lead averaged $127, significantly higher than industry benchmarks for outdoor ecommerce. The company lacked proper attribution between ad clicks and actual purchases, making it difficult to optimize campaigns based on revenue rather than vanity metrics. Their definition of a 'qualified lead' was too broad, including newsletter signups and product page views rather than focusing on high-intent actions that correlated with purchases, leading to budget allocation toward low-converting traffic sources.",
