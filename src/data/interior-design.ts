Founded 7 years ago, the firm had built strong relationships with local architects and contractors but struggled to reach homeowners directly through digital channels. Their portfolio includes projects ranging from $15K room makeovers to $150K+ whole-home redesigns, with an average project value of $34K. The team excels at creating sophisticated, livable spaces but their online presence wasn't reflecting their expertise or attracting the right clientele.",

Their website lacked neighborhood-specific content for key markets like Liberty Lake, Coeur d'Alene, and downtown Spokane.",
