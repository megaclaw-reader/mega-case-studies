The practice had built a solid reputation through patient referrals and community presence over 11 years, but their digital marketing wasn't keeping pace with newer competitors investing heavily in online visibility. They had a functional website with basic service pages and a Google Business Profile, but weren't leveraging local SEO or running paid campaigns efficiently enough to fill their schedule consistently.",

      description: "The practice was spending roughly $10K per month on paid campaigns but generating leads at a cost per qualified appointment of around $193. Qualification rates hovered near 48% — too many inquiries were price-shoppers or out-of-area patients who never converted to booked appointments.",
