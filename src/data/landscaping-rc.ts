    description: "An established design-build landscaping firm serving affluent residential communities and commercial properties across the greater Charlotte metro — including Lake Norman, Ballantyne, Myers Park, SouthPark, and Huntersville. The company offered full-service landscape architecture, hardscaping, outdoor lighting, irrigation systems, pool surrounds, seasonal maintenance, and commercial grounds management for corporate campuses, HOA communities, and retail properties. They had earned multiple regional design awards and maintained a strong referral pipeline, but their digital footprint hadn't kept pace with newer competitors investing aggressively in local SEO and paid search. With a goal of expanding their commercial division while sustaining residential growth, they needed a dual-channel strategy that could deliver measurable ROI across both segments.",

      description: "Despite 14 years in business, 50+ design awards, and a portfolio of high-end residential and commercial projects, the company's website ranked for only 197 keywords — almost entirely branded terms. Organic traffic averaged 412 visits per month, and their Google Business Profile had strong reviews (4.8 stars, 127 reviews) but wasn't appearing consistently in the local 3-pack for high-intent queries like 'landscape design Charlotte NC' or 'commercial landscaping Lake Norman.' Competitors with half their experience were outranking them through content and local SEO investment.",

    {
      title: "No Separation Between Residential and Commercial Marketing",
      description: "The company's website treated residential and commercial services as a single offering, with no dedicated landing pages, case studies, or messaging for property managers, HOA boards, or commercial developers. Their paid campaigns ran a single set of ads to both audiences, resulting in mismatched messaging — residential prospects seeing commercial-oriented copy and vice versa. This led to a 41% bounce rate on service pages and a cost per qualified lead of $187 that the ownership team considered unsustainable at scale.",

    {
      title: "Seasonal Revenue Volatility Without Strategic Budget Allocation",
      description: "The Charlotte landscaping market sees peak demand from March through October, with significant drop-off during winter months. The company's marketing spend was flat year-round — $10,000/month regardless of seasonal demand — meaning they were overspending during low-intent winter months and under-investing during the spring surge when competition for ad placement was fiercest. They had no seasonal content calendar and no retargeting strategy to nurture leads during the slower months for spring conversion.",
