    description: "A growing multi-practice law firm serving the Greater Toronto Area with a focus on personal injury, family law, immigration, and employment law. Established 9 years ago, the firm had earned a strong reputation through word-of-mouth and courtroom results — including several significant PI settlements — but was struggling to compete digitally against larger firms running aggressive year-round campaigns. With a main office in Midtown and a satellite location in Scarborough, the firm needed a comprehensive digital strategy to capture high-intent prospects across Toronto, North York, Etobicoke, Scarborough, and Mississauga. Their goal was to grow consultation volume by at least 35% while improving lead quality and reducing dependence on costly third-party legal lead services.",

Organic traffic averaged 253 monthly visits, with minimal content targeting high-value practice areas. Major Toronto PI firms were spending $30K–$50K monthly on paid search, pushing this firm off the first page for critical queries like 'personal injury lawyer Toronto' and 'family lawyer near me.' The firm's content strategy was nonexistent — just 4 blog posts published in the last 3 years.",

The firm was spending approximately $3,800/month on aggregator leads that converted to signed retainers at just 7.1%. Their own paid campaigns were poorly organized — a single campaign mixing all practice areas — resulting in a blended cost per qualified lead of $263 and wasted spend on informational and mismatched queries exceeding 41%.",

There was zero visibility into which channels or campaigns generated leads. Paid traffic was directed to the homepage. Mobile load time was 5.8 seconds, schema markup was absent, and the site had no location-specific pages targeting GTA neighborhoods. Paid traffic conversion rate sat at 1.9%, well below the Canadian legal services benchmark.",
